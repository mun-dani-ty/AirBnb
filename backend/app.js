//Create a variable called isProduction that will be true if the environment is in production or not by checking the environment key in the configuration file (backend/config/index.js):
const { environment } = require('./config');
const isProduction = environment === 'production';

//Initialize the Express application:
const app = express();

//Adding routes to the Express application
const routes = require('./routes');
const { ValidationError } = require('sequelize');

//Connect the morgan middleware for logging information about requests and responses:
app.use(morgan('dev'));

//Add the cookie-parser middleware for parsing cookies and the express.json middleware for parsing JSON bodies of requests with Content-Type of "application/json"
app.use(cookieParser());
app.use(express.json());

//Security middlewares

//Only allow CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) in development using the cors middleware because the React frontend will be served from a different server than the Express server. CORS isn't needed in production since all of our React and Express resources will come from the same origin.

//Enable better overall security with the helmet middleware (for more on what helmet is doing, see helmet on the npm registry). React is generally safe at mitigating XSS (i.e., Cross-Site Scripting) attacks, but do be sure to research how to protect your users from such attacks in React when deploying a large production application. Now add the crossOriginResourcePolicy to the helmet middleware with a policy of cross-origin. This will allow images with URLs to render in deployment.

//Add the csurf middleware and configure it to use cookies.

// Security Middleware
if (!isProduction) {
    // enable cors only in development
    app.use(cors());
}

// helmet helps set a variety of headers to better secure your app
app.use(
    helmet.crossOriginResourcePolicy({
        policy: "cross-origin"
    })
);

// Set the _csrf token and create req.csrfToken method
app.use(
    csurf({
        cookie: {
            secure: isProduction,
            sameSite: isProduction && "Lax",
            httpOnly: true
        }
    })
);

//The csurf middleware will add a _csrf cookie that is HTTP-only (can't be read by JavaScript) to any server response. It also adds a method on all requests (req.csrfToken) that will be set to another cookie (XSRF-TOKEN) later on. These two cookies work together to provide CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection for your application. The XSRF-TOKEN cookie value needs to be sent in the header of any request with all HTTP verbs besides GET. This header will be used to validate the _csrf cookie to confirm that the request comes from your site and not an unauthorized site.

//Routes
app.use(routes); // Connect all the routes

//Error handling middleware: https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html#middleware.error-handling

// Catch unhandled requests and forward to error handler.
app.use((_req, _res, next) => {
    const err = new Error("The requested resource couldn't be found.");
    err.title = "Resource Not Found";
    err.errors = ["The requested resource couldn't be found."];
    err.status = 404;
    next(err);
});

//If this resource-not-found middleware is called, an error will be created with the message "The requested resource couldn't be found." and a status code of 404. Afterwards, next will be invoked with the error. Remember, next invoked with nothing means that error handlers defined after this middleware will not be invoked. However, next invoked with an error means that error handlers defined after this middleware will be invoked.

// Process sequelize errors
app.use((err, _req, _res, next) => {
    // check if error is a Sequelize error:
    if (err instanceof ValidationError) {
        let errors = {};
        for (let error of err.errors) {
            errors[error.path] = error.message;
        }
        err.title = 'Validation error';
        err.errors = errors;
    }
    next(err);
});

//If the error that caused this error-handler to be called is an instance of ValidationError from the sequelize package, then the error was created from a Sequelize database validation error and the additional keys of title string and errors array will be added to the error and passed into the next error handling middleware.

// Error formatter
app.use((err, _req, res, _next) => {
    res.status(err.status || 500);
    console.error(err);
    res.json({
        title: err.title || 'Server Error',
        message: err.message,
        errors: err.errors,
        stack: isProduction ? null : err.stack
    });
});

//The last error handler is for formatting all the errors before returning a JSON response. It will include the error message, the errors array, and the error stack trace (if the environment is in development) with the status code of the error message.
