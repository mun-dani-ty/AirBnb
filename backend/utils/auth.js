//first function is setting the JWT cookie after a user is logged in or signed up
//It takes in the response and the session user and generates a JWT using the imported secret. It is set to expire in however many seconds you set on the JWT_EXPIRES_IN key in the .env file. The payload of the JWT will be the return of the instance method .toSafeObject that you added previously to the User model. After the JWT is created, it's set to an HTTP-only cookie on the response as a token cookie.

// Sends a JWT Cookie
const setTokenCookie = (res, user) => {
    // Create the token.
    const token = jwt.sign(
        { data: user.toSafeObject() },

//Create a middleware function that will verify and parse the JWT's payload and search the database for a User with the id in the payload. (This query should use the currentUser scope since the hashedPassword is not needed for this operation.) If there is a User found, then save the user to a key of user onto the Request, req.user. If there is an error verifying the JWT or a User cannot be found with the id, then clear the token cookie from the response and set req.user to null.
const restoreUser = (req, res, next) => {
    // token parsed from cookies
    const { token } = req.cookies;
    req.user = null;

    return jwt.verify(token, secret, null, async (err, jwtPayload) => {

            return next();

        return next();
    });
};
//The restoreUser middleware will be connected to the API router so that all API route handlers will check if there is a current user logged in or not.


//Create an Express middleware called requireAuth. Define this middleware as an array with the restoreUser middleware function you just created as the first element in the array. This will ensure that if a valid JWT cookie exists, the session user will be loaded into the req.user attribute. The second middleware will check req.user and will go to the next middleware if there is a session user present there. If there is no session user, then an error will be created and passed along to the error-handling middlewares.
// If there is no current user, return an error
const requireAuth = function (req, _res, next) {
    if (req.user) return next();

    const err = new Error('Authentication required');
    err.title = 'Authentication required';
    // err.errors = ['Unauthorized'];
    err.status = 401;
    return next(err);
}

//requireAuth will be connected directly to route handlers where there needs to be a current user logged in for the actions in those route handlers.
